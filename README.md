 * comfortable calling web / cloud APIs

```
PROTOTYPE
```

```
REQUIREMENTS
```

aka "How does Firebase play into this"

 * Database ==> to store messages
 * File Storage ==> to store media/attachments in message
 * App Server ==> to coordinate all these functions
 * Authentication ==> to know sender / receiver identity
 * Analytics ==> e.g., understanding user behaviors
 * Engagement ==> e.g., push notifications
 * Monetization ==> e.g., showing advertisements

All of this is plumbing. You really want to focus on the front-end and the user experience. Can you outsource the plumbing?

SCAFFOLDING
```

 Download [Android Base Project](https://github.com/udacity/and-nd-firebase) or [iOS Base Project](https://github.com/udacity/ios-nd-firebase) and set up as follows:

  * Download zip file from one of the above links (here we cover Android)
  * Unzip into your local directory (creates directory and-nd-firebase... ) and rename to something simple (firecamp-friendlychat)
  * Open it in Android Studio (as an existing project) - make sure you fix any missing dependencies.
  * Run the emulator once to make sure the scaffolded app works
