# Firebase in a weekend

Goals are:
 
 * understand firebase features
 * understand firebase tools & APIs
 * build a full-fledged Firebase-driven app
 * understand how to build iOS, Android & web versions
 
 Pre-requisites are:

 * understanding of what a mobile app is
 * comfortable using command line
 * comfortable calling web / cloud APIs

What you will build: Friendly Chat App
 * Login screen (Google/Email)
 * View messages
 * Real-time send/receive

Requirements (or how Firebase plays into this)

 * Database ==> to store messages
 * File Storage ==> to store media/attachments in message
 * App Server ==> to coordinate all these functions
 * Authentication ==> to know sender / receiver identity
 * Analytics ==> e.g., understanding user behaviors
 * Engagement ==> e.g., push notifications
 * Monetization ==> e.g., showing advertisements

All of this is plumbing. You really want to focus on the front-end and the user experience. Can you outsource the plumbing? 

Enter Firebase:
 
  * Firebase Realtime Database
  * Firebase Storage
  * Firebase Authentication
  * Firebase Analytics
  * Firebase Notifications
  * Firebase Remote Config (A/B testing)
